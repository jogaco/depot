== Depot: Pragmatic Bookshelf

Implementation of the sample Depot app developed in the book "Pragmatic Agile Web Dev with Rails".

I initially started implementing the app with Rails 3 version of the book, but replacing Scriptaculous
with jQuery + jQuery-ui.
Later on, I upgraded my book to Rails 3.2 version.

My implementation is Heroku-ready. It uses the Rails asset pipeline.
